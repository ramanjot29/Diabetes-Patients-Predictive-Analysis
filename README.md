# Diabetes Prediction Project (Internship Project from MeriSkill)

## Overview
This project, conducted as part of my internship with MeriSkill, aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various diagnostic measurements. 
The dataset used in this project is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective is to develop a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes.

## Dataset
The dataset includes several features (independent variables) and one target variable (Outcome) indicating whether a patient has diabetes (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

Features:
- Pregnancies: The number of pregnancies a patient has had.
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration, an indicator of blood sugar levels.
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure.
- SkinThickness: Skinfold thickness, possibly related to body composition.
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin level.
- BMI: A measure of body weight and height, indicating body fat.
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A measure of the diabetes heredity risk based on family history.
- Age: The age of the patient in years.

Target Variable:
- Outcome: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration and analysis of the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and converting numerical data into categorical variables.
- **Model Building**: Developing predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various evaluation metrics.
- **Conclusion**: Recommendations and conclusions based on model performance.


## Acknowledgments
